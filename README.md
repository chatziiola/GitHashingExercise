GitHashing: A Git and CLI Learning Project

Welcome to GitHashing, a simple project in the context of the Operating Software course as it was taught in E.C.E A.U.Th, in the fall semester of 2023. Its aim is to gain hands-on familiarity with Git and the command line, since much of the course is centered around proper CLI usage and system administration skills, engaging in exercises with bash, fish and various other tools.
Additionally, the course involves a study of low-level C programming, offering a holistic approach to understanding software development tools and techniques.
